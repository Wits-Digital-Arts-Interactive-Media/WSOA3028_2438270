            <p>
                <b>Introduction</b>
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                With a small amount of historic context, plenty of conventions we have adopted have backgrounds deeply rooted in colonial ideology. The vast number of social and cultural norms, conventions that underpin technology and knowledge pools (in the form of academia with origins that stretch back to pseudoscience), created, perpetuated, and eventually internalized by most, if not all members of the society, with an origin structured from an imperial colonial framework is simply overwhelming.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                As an example of how deeply colonial thought has influenced our social norms, we must examine our food habits. As Mahek Nair (2023) of “perspectives on global health” stated “colonialism is both an outstandingly obvious yet equally concealed super-structure which dictates so much of how our lives are lived. When, and what, we eat often seems to revolve around the ways humans have adapted to the white supremacy mindset”. Mahek then details the impressions early European colonizers had of the dieting philosophy of native Americans, which primarily revolved around the idea of eating when hungry, as opposed to the European’s philosophy underpinned by an idea mentioned by Abigail Carroll, mentioned in Mahek’s article. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                She mentioned that European colonizers believed “civilized people ate properly and boundaried their eating, thus, differentiating themselves from the animal kingdom, where grazing is the norm” (Carroll, 2013). The “three meals a day” rule was then imposed as a means to domesticate the indigenous communities (Nair, 2023). A rule still practiced and encouraged today. To some, this might seem like a comical example of how colonization influences our lives. However, this shows just how far the colonial ideology permeated through large social structures like religion and tradition, and even through the smallest aspects of lives like our dietary habits.  
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <b>Digital colonialism</b>
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                That slightly longwinded introduction serves as means to conceptualise the main purpose of this paper, analysing how colonization influences our technology. Similar to the “three meals a day” rule, the idea that the conventions that dictate the creation of technology and our relationship with it, might have been influenced by colonization is often overlooked or rarely noticed. However, when looking deeper, it is very evident that colonization played a huge role in how technology has developed. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                An important article to use that will further contextualise this conversation is Sareeta Amrute’s keynote talk at EPIC2019 on “Tech Colonialism Today”. This article serves at a great framework for this paper as Sareeta tackles several sub-topics around tech colonialism. The most important being the mirrored relationship between colonization and digital colonialism. As she states (2019), a colonial relationship is hierarchical, extractive and exploitative, further stating that “it produces uneven consequences and malevolent paternalisms. In summary, Sareeta Amrute defines the colonial relationship as follows:
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The forcefully enforced division of the perceived inferior and superior produces the hierarchical nature of the relationship. The extractive nature is seen in the diversion of resources from Asia, Africa, and the Americas to Europe. It is exploitative “through labour relations that take advantage of the state monopoly over violence, either directly, or indirectly, through pressure applied to putatively independent states” (Amrute, 2019). When the elitists take up the role of inventors, while the colonized generally take up the role of bearers of risk, it creates this uneven consequence. Lastly, solutions for the betterment of the colonized are propositioned, but the colonized are never seen as agent participants in the creation of these solutions. This relates to the malevolent paternalism of colonial relations.  
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The next step Sareeta takes is relating these colonial relations to digital colonialism. An interesting point she brought up refers to techno-chauvinism, as referred to by Meredith Broussard. The idea that “these companies that produce the technology also produce an ideology of superiority” (Broussard, 2019). Broussard defines techno-chauvinism, as Sareeta mentions in her article, the belief that a small group of similar developers located in Silicon Valley that they are the best people to deploy a small set of algorithmic applications to administer human life (Broussard, 2019). In addition to this take, Sareeta adds the idea of meritocracy. The reason this is important to note is because of an often underplayed and ignored social issue, Digital Inequality. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <b>The relationship between digital colonialism and digital inequality</b>
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                An often-ignored social issue is digital inequality. The idea of techno-chauvinism presents itself as the other side of digital inequality. In the sense that these “superior” homogenous group believe they can cater to everyone’s unique needs. An adjacent sentiment might come in the form of full-blown exclusion. Creating technology that solely caters to those who create it. This then eventually lead to digital inequality. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The perceived global benefit and global reach of the colonial ideal, like the internet, is grossly exaggerated. As Laura Robinson, Shelia R. Cotten, Hiroshi Ono, Anabel Quan-Haase, Gustavo Mesch, Wenhong Chenf, Jeremy Schulz, Timothy M. Hale, and Michael J. Stern (2015) mention in their article relating to digital inequality, there is a perceived “global reach” of internet access and usage, when this cannot be further from the truth. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                A large group of people have no say in how the technology is created, or how they are represented. One could say this echoes Sareeta’s idea of the uneven consequence of colonial relation. Even further than that, the issue of digital inequality is made worse when the origins of the minerals and materials used to create these technologies is made clear. As Sareeta mentions, this is an aspect of digital colonialism (2019). The extraction of minerals from colonized land. Not only in the form of mineral extraction, but it also manifests itself in the form of data extraction.  This combined with the idea of the malevolent paternalisms. These technological solutions are presented as universal fixes, but the indigenous population is often excluded in the creation of these solutions. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <b>Digital colonialism through the eyes of case studies</b>
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                To dive deeper into this topic, a case study would be needed. A relevant article about Google and its decision to axe hundreds of “core” employees, opting to move some positions to India and Mexico. In a CNBC article, Jennifer Elias (2024) notes a few things. For instance, quoting a statement from Google Developer Ecosystem vice president Asim Husain (2024), “we intend to maintain our current global footprint while also expanding in high-growth workforce location so that we can operate closer to our partners and developer communities”.  
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Thinking about digital colonialism, it is very easy to see why this sentiment might not ring true and honest to everyone. For example, the mentioning of Google’s intention to maintain their global footprint echoes colonial sentiments. The desire to maintain their global monopoly. Another important thing to note is the reference to “expanding in high-growth workforce location”. As Sareeta mentioned, a colonial relation is one tied to exploitation. The unfortunate, and uncommon trend when it comes to outsourcing labour, is as a cost cutting method. Not to ensure the company stays afloat, but in order to bolster their income even further by underpaying foreign labour or seeking cheaper labour. This is an unfortunate trend of global corporations. As mentioned in the article, these cuts come as the company enjoys its fastest growth rate since 2022 (Elias, 2024). This continuous to perpetuate the sentiments of colonization.   
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <b>What now?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                If this trend persists, it presents a very gloomy future for indigenous developers. We will not be seen as key players in contributing to the innovations and advancement of the global software market. Instead, formerly colonized peoples will be seen as a route to continue this cycle of colonial ideology through extraction and exploitation, as Sareeta mentioned. This then creates more issues. The uneven consequence of colonial relationships will persist. The only way to avoid this, is with a complete shift. A shift in how we engage with technology, how we produce technology, the conventions that go into producing these technologies. When we centre the voices of indigenous people, we no look at them as a commodity, but as an active participant in the creation and usage of these technologies.
