                <img src="Images/1st Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my 1st Wireframe design." 
                title="Wireframe 1">

            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 1:</b>
                The main reason for this design choice, was its simplicity and effectiveness. 
                I feel like this website design would accomplish its intended purpose. 
                Viewers would be able to navigate the website with relative ease. 
                There is no unnecessary clutter to distract or overwhelm the viewer. 
                This seems to be a positive and negative. The viewer isn’t distracted by the backgrounds or a complicated UI layout. 
                However, the simplistic design might be way too boring for some viewers. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="Images/2nd Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my 2st Wireframe design." 
                title="Wireframe 2">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 2:</b>
                The framework of this design and the last are effectively the same. 
                The main aim was for a clean, minimalist appearance. 
                A non-cluttered UI interface. 
                Similar to the first design, the main issue with this layout is it effectively boring to look at. 
                It feels very cookie-cutter. Which isn’t a bad thing, but it really soaks up excitement like a sponge. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="Images/3rd Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my 3rd Wireframe design." 
                title="Wireframe 3">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 3:</b>
                This is the design I liked out of the 3. 
                This design is also very simplistic. 
                However, the floating lettering telling the viewer what page they are on, 
                as well as the uniform square buttons provide a much-needed touch of excitement. 
                A cool little logo would also push the excitement factor further. 
                The only thing I’m left questioning is the home button. It seems kind of useless to have a home button on the home page.
            </p>

                <img src="Images/4th Wireframe .png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my 4th Wireframe design." 
                title="Wireframe 4">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 4:</b>
                This layout removes the home button from the home page.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="Images/5th Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my 5th Wireframe design." 
                title="Wireframe 5">
            </p>
            <P>
                <b>Blog page idea 1:</b>
                This layout is an extension of Home page idea 4. 
                For this layout, it makes more sense to have the home button in the top centre of the page. 
                The floating lettering remain to give the page a cooler appearance. 
                With this layout, the viewer can see all of the blog posts as they load into the page. 
                My only gripe with this is that it looks quite cluttered. 

            </P>

                <img src="Images/6th Wireframe.png"

                title="Wireframe 6">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Blog page idea 2:</b>
                This layout removes the cluttered look of all the blog post buttons, 
                replacing them with larger buttons in a row. 
                For this layout, the viewer would have to scroll across to access the other blog posts. 
            </p>

                <img src="Images/7th Wireframe.png"

                title="Wireframe 7">

            <P>
                <b>Blog post idea 3:</b>
                This layout simply replaces the scrollbar with a button.
            </P>

                <b>Portfolio page idea 1:</b>

                <b>Info page:</b>
                My info page will be fairly simple. My Instagram and other pages will go in the green space.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Images/13th Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my Information structure." 
                title="Information structure 1">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Information structure:</b>
                for my information structure, 
                I pictured 2 separate parts. 
                I assume that users engaging in the written sections of my website would be focused on reading and would do without the distraction of the 
                portfolio. 
                The sentiment is the same for the portfolio viewers. 
                The only difference between these sections is the fact that I’ve linked the written work together. 
                Because of its text-based format, I assume users would be more incline to browser similar media at a time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="Images/14 Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my User Experience map." 
                title="Map of User Experience">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>User experience: </b>
                adding to my information structure, 
                the map of my user’s movement would follow this trend of media with similarities being grouped together. 
                There are a few ways they can move through the written work, hence the multiple paths on the map. 
                But since the portfolio is the only thing with non-written work, 
                I assume users would engage with that only, then move on to the written work. 
            </p>

                <img src="Images/Information structure .png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="This is a picture of my Information Structure." 
                title="Information Structure">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Information Structure:</b>
                <p>
                    <b>What information should be on a screen:</b>
                    I imagine each page would consist of only what is needed in order to not overwhelm the user. 
                    I want the users to have an uninterrupted and seamless viewing experience, engaging with one piece of the website at a time. 
                    If they are looking at the blog posts, its just that. They aren’t distracted by unnecessary UI elements or clutter. 
                </p>
