            <p class="p-summary">Week 4 blog post: 
                <br>
                This blog looks at my goal alignment and a reflection of how my website has turned out.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Work through the IxD Process and begin noting your thoughts:</h2>
            <h3>Goal Alignment:</h3>
            <p>
                My Goal:
                I want a website that, at its base, is functional. 
                But beyond that, I want my website to be minimalist with a twist. 
                I don’t want my website to be too busy and distracting, but also not too simple that its extremely boring to engage with. 
                I don’t think I’ll be revolutionizing the web development industry with my design. 
                But regardless, I want a website that encourages its users to engage with all of its functions. 
                Presenting all of the websites features from the get-go is a good way to show the users all of their options and choices. 
                I also want a website that displays my art portfolio in a presentable way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Users:
                My user base would comprise of artsy folk that want to either watch my animations or look at my sketches. 
                I also image my user base would consist of artists that want to collaborate on work. 
                I want my users to enjoy my art on a streamlined website. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Content:
                My content would comprise of blogs, essays and my art portfolio. 
                I imagine these are my main components. 
                Additionally, the website will have my bio, in case users want to follow my various pages, 
                as well as my design section in the event users want to know the process of how I made the website and why I made the decisions I made. 
                I hope users are most engaged with my blogs, essays and portfolio as I feel those took the most amount of effort to make.
            </p>

            <h2>Revised information structure:</h2>
            <p>
                This is the revised information structure for the website and the user flow map. For the revised information structure, I have made a few changes. But for the user flow map, it has remained unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Information Structure:</b>
                <p>
                    <b>What information should be on a screen?</b>
                    I imagine each page would consist of only what is needed in order to not overwhelm the user. 
                    I want the users to have an uninterrupted and seamless viewing experience, engaging with one piece of the website at a time. 
                    If they are looking at the blog posts, its just that. They aren’t distracted by unnecessary UI elements or clutter.

            <h2>Reflect on my work for Website 1</h2>
            <p>
                At this moment I feel like web design might be the hardest thing I have ever done. 
                I mentioned in an earlier post about how difficult it was to do all the theory. 
                I realise now how important it is to place the theory above all. 
                Every single decision I have made and am yet to has to be calculated and intentional. 
                I am very used to creating things with the sole idea being “I thought it was cool”. 
                I realise now that it is an unsustainable model. 
                I need more reasoning behind the work I do and only put in elements of my website when I deem them completely intentional.
        
                I think I’ve struggle with that the most. 
                Finding a reason for every decision. 
                A reason for the font I want to use. 
                A reason for why I want to put a picture in this specific place. 
                I might be exaggerating this, but I feel like I need to put myself in the headspace of being more intentional with my design choices. 
        
                I cannot really say I am proud of any specific moment right now. 
                I think I will be tested when java and CSS are introduced, but for now, 
                I am proud of being able to actually publish a somewhat half working website.
