            <h1>Blog Post 2: Interaction and the www</h1>

            <section>
            <h2>Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:</h2>
            <p> 
                As it is, my folder structure is simple. The image folder will hold the images I want to add to the page, while the JavaScript and CSS folders are empty, as of right now. There’s a folder called “pages” mainly because I had planned on placing the index, the blog, the portfolio, and essay html files into that folder. Less for functional reasons, but more for organizational purposes. This was until Hanli mentioned that the index must be the root or in the root (might be a bit unclear about that). After she said this, I got a bit scared to put the index inside of a different folder in case it renders the webpage unusable.In terms of the URL scheme, I am yet to customize the URL scheme. But as a reference to what I want to do, I am planning on having a clean and simple URL scheme. The ideal scheme would either be one that allows the viewer to know exactly what pages they’ve interacted with (blogposts/blogpostweek2), or one that does not overwhelm the user (Home/BlogPostWeek2). 
                A URL scheme like that is easy to read and understand. In terms of performance, 
                I’d strive for a URL scheme that works on the lowest bandwidth. 
                I think it would be beneficial to not overload the website with images and text that eat up data.

            <h2>Website Wireframes:</h2>
            <p>
                Here are my 1st iteration wireframes for the various pages I'll have on the website. I have tried to list some advantages and disadvantages for each layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 1:</b>
                The main reason for this design choice, was its simplicity and effectiveness. 
                I feel like this website design would accomplish its intended purpose. 
                Viewers would be able to navigate the website with relative ease. 
                There is no unnecessary clutter to distract or overwhelm the viewer. 
                This seems to be a positive and negative. The viewer isn’t distracted by the backgrounds or a complicated UI layout. 
                However, the simplistic design might be way too boring for some viewers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Images/1st Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 1st Home page Wireframe design." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 1">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 2:</b>
                The framework of this design and the last are effectively the same. 
                The main aim was for a clean, minimalist appearance. 
                A non-cluttered UI interface. 
                Similar to the first design, the main issue with this layout is it effectively boring to look at. 
                It feels very cookie-cutter. Which isn’t a bad thing, but it really soaks up excitement like a sponge. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Images/2nd Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 2nd Home page Wireframe design.." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 2">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 3:</b>
                This is the design I liked out of the 3. 
                This design is also very simplistic. 
                However, the floating lettering telling the viewer what page they are on, 
                as well as the uniform square buttons provide a much-needed touch of excitement. 
                A cool little logo would also push the excitement factor further. 
                The only thing I’m left questioning is the home button. It seems kind of useless to have a home button on the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Images/3rd Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 3rd Home page Wireframe design." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 3">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 4:</b>
                This layout removes the home button from the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Images/4th Wireframe .png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 4th Home page Wireframe design." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 4">
            </p>
            <P>
                <b>Blog page idea 1:</b>
                This layout is an extension of Home page idea 4. 
                For this layout, it makes more sense to have the home button in the top centre of the page. 
                The floating lettering remain to give the page a cooler appearance. 
                With this layout, the viewer can see all of the blog posts as they load into the page. 
                My only gripe with this is that it looks quite cluttered.

                title="Blog page-Wireframe 1">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Blog page idea 2:</b>
                This layout removes the cluttered look of all the blog post buttons, 
                replacing them with larger buttons in a row. 
                For this layout, the viewer would have to scroll across to access the other blog posts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Images/6th Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 2nd Blog post page design." 
                title="Blog page-Wireframe 2">
            </p>
            <P>
                <b>Blog post idea 3:</b>
                This layout simply replaces the scrollbar with a button.
            </P>

            <P>
                <b>Portfolio page idea 1:</b>
                Like the blog post page, this variation employs a scrollbar.

            </p>
            <P>
                <b>Portfolio page idea 2:</b>
                This layout uses buttons for navigation.

                My info page will be fairly simple. The links to my Instagram and other pages will go in the green space.

            <h2>Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: 
                how does it speak to the internet today?:</h2>
                <p>
                    One thing I found interesting about the reading was the distinction between the internet and the Web. 
                    A quick google search and a BBC article immediately answered my question. The article differentiated the web and the internet in this way:
                    “The world wide web, or web for short, are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online.
                    But the internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on, as well as what emails and files travel across.”
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/av/47523993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Website article</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    The reason this differentiation stood out to me was because of how interchangeable these words have become, and I think this was a good reminder that these concepts are very much different even though we might use them to define each other.  
            
                    One benefit of hypertext I got from the reading was the advantage of a “malleable” form of text. Unlike books, hypertext can be manipulated at will. The process in which these texts are edited and shared also differs to that of books. 
                    To edit a book would mean physically editing the text, and reprinting the book, which is an obviously tedious and arduous process. But with hyperlinks, a web dev can easily make changes to text and publish those changes almost instantly. 
                    These method of publication makes it easier for anyone to put their ideas out into the world without the limitations of printed text. Not to say that printed text has become or will become obsolete. 
                    “Nelson foresees a renovation of culture, a unification of discourse, a reader-and-writer’s paradise where all writing opens itself to/in the commerce of ideas. 
                    This is the world in which all “work” becomes “text,” not substance but reference, not containment but connection” (1991; 48). 
                    This quote exemplifies what I was talking about. The idea that hyperlinks could open the potential for anyone to produce and access information. 
                    This is definitely a positive and negative. the positive being the access to information being easily accessible to everyone and not reserved for the elitists. 
                    But on the flipside of that, you have the potential for the spread of misinformation. 
                    I believe the access to this information is a very big positive, but the production of the information should be reserved. 
                    This then brings up another daunting task. Who are those reserved to produce information? How do we qualify them? 
                    I didn’t think this reading would bring up so many philosophical points for me, but as I read it, my thinking went straight to those thoughts. 
                    I found it quite difficult to separate my analysis from those philosophical points.

            <h2>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?:</h2>
            <p>
                When I think about interaction, the quote by Lev Manovich. 
                “As with digital I avoid using the word interactive in this book without qualifying it, for the same reason – 
                I find the concept to be too broad to be truly useful… 
                Once an object is represented in a computer, it automatically becomes interactive. 
                Therefore, to call computer media ‘interactive’ is meaningless – it simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.” (Manovich, p55).
        
                This is one of the more interesting quotes I’ve read regarding interaction, and it’s also why I struggle with defining “interaction”. As Manovich states, the most basic function of working on a computer could constitute interactivity. This way of reasoning makes it slightly difficult to really pin down the meaning of interaction. It is also important to acknowledge that this is interactivity from the framework of computers. Interacting with other forms of media requires a different approach. Gonzalo Frasca also made a point that I’d like to reference. When it comes to text-based media, the act of simply turning a page cannot be seen as interaction as the text is not being modified. 
                Therefore, a happy medium would be something that combines the thoughts of Gonzalo Frasca and Espen Aarseth, who suggested the use of the word ergodic instead, describing ergodic literature as text that requires “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.”

            <h2>Reflection on the door design video:</h2>
            <p>
                The video about design was very insightful and thought provoking. 
                Don Norman’s take on design with functionality in mind is very useful to remember. 
                If you design something with its functionality in mind, it sort of negates the need to over-explain the mechanics or functions of the webpage or the device. 
                The explanation of how to use the item is embedded in its design.
