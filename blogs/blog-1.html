                <br>
                This blog looks at my experience using GitHub, a reflection on a reading and my goals for this course.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                My experience with GitHub, this time around, was a bit tamer than it was last year. 
                Having some experience with GitHub in 2023 made the process of creating a repository and cloning a lot easier. 
                The only new thing was publishing to pages. I am still slightly unsure about the processes that go on behind the scenes when publishing to pages. 
                I just always assumed that web developers coded their websites and somehow it ends up on the internet. 
                It’s definitely my fault for not looking further into the actual processes that go into creating and sharing a website. 
                But at the moment, I feel optimistic about what will come of this module. 
                A little optimistic, and a little bit scared. 
            </p>

            <h2>Reflection on the readings you selected- relating it to your experiences with the internet today:</h2>
            <br>

            <h3>The World Wide Web:</h3>
            <br>

            <p>
                One of the most interesting things about this reading, is how topical and timelessness it feels. 
                Despite it being written in 1994, most of the concepts we see today seem unchanged. You can tell the age of the test just by reading it. 
                There’s a “retro” feel to calling a computer a “desktop machine” <cite>(Berners Lee et al., 1994; 76)</cite>. Despite this, the reading manages to feel present. 
                One other thing I found interesting, in the beginning of the reading, was the use of the word “object”. For example, the “object” in the URI paragraph, to me at least, represents the webpage itself. 
                The reason I say this is because of the reading’s phrasing. “… one can form an address for any object as the set of protocol parameters necessary to access the object” <cite>(Berners Lee et al., 1994)</cite>.  
                That line in the reading made me think the object in question is the website, specifically the “access the object”. I understood that line to mean a URI is used to access the website. 
                Having URIs as a concept in this reading tripped me up a bit because I got confused with URLs. Researching further, I learned that URIs and URLs are different things. A URL is a specific type of URI.
                The last thing I found interesting about this reading were the bullet points about the future of the web. 
                Its very interesting that most of the goals for the future of the web were realized, for example, “conventions on the Internet for charging and commercial use to allow direct access to for-profit services” <cite>(Berners Lee et al., 1994)</cite>
                I understand this to mean the ability to use the internet for commercial reasons. The monetization of the internet’s capabilities. Having the ability to buy and sell on the internet. 
            </p>

            <h2>Interesting things you have found about the history of the web:</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                One of the most interesting things I’ve learned about the internet is the impact it had. 
                The creation of the internet is one of the most important advancements in human history. 
                From entertainment to knowledge sharing, the internet was huge in terms of its cultural, societal, political shaping of the human consciousness and experience. 
                An impact that is almost unexplainable through words.  
            </p>

            <h2>Your goals for this course:</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                Learn how to create an excellent website for my animation portfolio. 
                I believe having a very unique and well-designed website could enhance my art. 
                It could make it more attractive to people who want to hire me, 
                or just people who want to enjoy my drawings, but I think attracting prospective employers would be the main goal for creating 
                a great website. 
                And I feel the skills learned in this course will serve me for a while, seeing that the internet is growing and expanding, 
                with a chance of it dying out nowhere nearby.
