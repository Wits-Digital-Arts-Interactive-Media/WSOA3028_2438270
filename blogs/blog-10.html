                <br>
                For this week’s blog post,

            <h2>Continue writing about your development process. You could reflect on: How your CSS relates to the HTML and JS:</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                I feel like the relationship between CSS and HTML is fairly simple. The HTML gives the webpage structure and content, while the JavaScript gives the website functionality and CSS adds styling. This is where I realize how finicky CSS can be. Not finicky in a bad way. It’s just easy to get lost in, and add as much as you can, but at the same time, things can break quite easily. And then on top of that, there’s intentionality that you must keep in mind. Like proper and intentional semantic markup and meta-data usage, and JavaScript functionality, the intentionality of how you use CSS is incredibly important. This is an aspect I need to force myself to understand and implement. My website can come out a certain way, but there must be reasons for why it exists in that state, with those specific styling choices. For now, I imagine my website being slightly minimalist, with a touch of color and humor to draw the user in. If I go for pull minimalism, the website might seem a bit too intense or serious, which is not the aesthetic I want it to give off. Using brighter complimentary colors might help with this. Black and white seems to give off a more serious tone, while brighter colors give off a more inviting tone. I also believe CSS can also help visualize JavaScript functionality. Like adding an effect when the user clicks on the “scroll to top of page” button or adding style to the JavaScript navigation.

            <h2>The benefits and challenges of responsive design:</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                When it comes to responsive design, I feel like there are more benefits than downsides. Having your website useable on many form factors is very important. It might help increase the pool of users, seeing as everyone might use a different device to access the website. It helps with accessibility in that area. The challenge of this is the restricted screen-space of certain devices. Not only screen size restrictions, but also functionality differences. When it comes to desktop, the user can hover with the mouse, grab, access drop-down menus with ease as opposed to mobile devices. Squashing content on a mobile device is also a challenge. When creating responsive text on mobile, the developer must be aware that some find it easier to read long pieces on their computer screen, as opposed to their mobile devices, so formatting text to fit smaller screens is important but also difficult to implement. Overall, the benefits of responsive design outweigh the challenges as this will make your website more accessible to larger groups of people. To me, I personally believe that responsive design implementation can show the user a level of care from the developer. When a developer takes account of those with conditions that make it harder to access and interact with the website “normally” and create ways for them to still enjoy and get the most out of the website is reflects a sense of care from the developer to the user. For those without dyslexia, it might not seem like a big deal, but for someone with the condition, having a button that changes the font and makes it more dyslexic-friendly, it can mean the world to them and increase their user experience.

            <h2>When thinking about how our code matters in decolonialism, can you identify any things in your own coding practice that you should be aware of?</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                Thinking about how coding can be used as a decolonializing technique is something I never thought possible. The list of norms, processes and beliefs framed by colonial rhetoric is extensive to say the least. Recognizing the reality of this and learning to identify when and where they occur is perhaps the first step to using coding as a method of decolonialism. Avoiding ways of exploiting the system and those who use it, while centering the voices and concerns of marginalized people. These are sentiments raised by Sareeta Amrute (2019) as she describes the colonial relationship and how we can see that bleed into our technology. A relationship predicated on hierarchical structuring, extractive and exploitative, the production of uneven consequences and malevolent paternalisms. Understanding how these relationships manifest themselves in the world of programming and web-design is extremely important. This stretches beyond simply coding. This conversation stretches as far as our impact and place in the workforce. Because of this, I have become aware, or at least try to be aware of, since learning about how coding can be used as a way towards decolonialism. Centering the techniques and knowledge of marginalized people. Being aware of the context that led to the code we use and being aware of the implications using it has, is also a way forward. One way I feel I can acknowledge decolonialism in my coding is by avoiding a replication of the colonial relationships Sareeta mentioned in my coding practice.
