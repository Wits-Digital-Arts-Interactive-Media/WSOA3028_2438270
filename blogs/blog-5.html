                <br>
                This blog looks at some pros and cons of some of my favourite artist portfolios.
            </p>

            <h2>Website Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                To get better at making effective websites, a web developer should look at websites that inspire them. An effective way to use inspirational websites to develop your own, is to analyse a few. Looking at the pros can give you inspiration, and looking at cons can show you what to avoid.
                <br>
                Seeing as the vision I have for my website is an animation portfolio, I thought it would be a good idea to analyse a few.

                    <b>Pros:</b> 
                    <br>
                    I am not always a fan of minimalism, but I love the minimalist design of this website. The white background really allows the artwork to stand out. The user is not confused about the purpose of the website because of its visual clarity. As soon as I tried to navigate through the website, I immediately assumed the frames are buttons that are enlarged when clicked, and that is exactly what it does. This is the same for the “Bradley Gake” button at the top left corner. Clicking on that button takes you to the home page. It employs very diegetic UI elements. The website showcasing this animation portfolio stated that the format theme of the website is called foray. The panel on the left with the tabs for the short animations and the artists information are always available to the users.
                    Navigating through this website is very easy. You never really get lost or confused or forget what tab you’re currently viewing.

                    <b>Cons:</b> 
                    <br>
                    Despite the constant availability of the buttons on the left, the font size and position make it easy to miss.
                    The drawings also don’t have titles when you hover over them. That isn’t a huge issue, but having the title pop up as you hover over the artwork would have made the viewing experience, and in turn, the user experience, slightly better.
                    There isn’t a fully-fledged “home page”. As soon you enter the website, it presents you with the “animation background” page. This is subjective whether it’s a pro or a con. It might have been better to let the user navigate the website in their own time without presenting a page before the user can make the conscious decision to engage with the page.

                    <br>
                    This website is the one of the best examples of the way I would want my site to look like. The format is also rather simple, but very effective. The grid format displays the art in very nicely using an Amazon format. And it is very interesting how it doesn’t feel overwhelming or clustered. It all feels very clean. It all communicates its purpose very clearly. The plain background also draws focus the artworks. The title of the piece pops up when you hover over the illustration or animation. The nav bar at the very top of the page is also very clear. The font is nicely legible. At the very bottom of the page, Yulia has the link to her social media accounts in the form of little logos that link to her various accounts. This is visually appealing and functional.

                    <b>Cons:</b> 
                    <br>
                    I couldn’t find too many cons with this website. The one issue I noticed was, like Bradley Gake's website, there isn't a dedicated home page. And the nav bar is also slightly difficult to see.

                    <b>Pros:</b> 
                    <br>
                    This is the website that really inspired me. I love how it looks minimalist, but it doesn’t look like it is. By this I mean the combination of the UI elements and images are not overwhelming or cluttered, that’s the minimalism of the website, but the colours used for the artwork and sketches invite the viewer to explore further.
                    It doesn’t translate the serious tone of a lot of other minimalist website designs. It perfectly combines a professional feel with the quirks of an animator portfolio. The drop-down menu when you hover over the “animation” and “personal work” tabs are a great idea. It negates the need to have a dedicated central animation page that branches off. Instead, the viewer can go to her animation tab and select her prop portfolio or character design portfolio from the drop-down. This also ties in well with the 3 click rule. This drop-down menu brings up an issue when looking at mobile navigation, which the website treads nicely. On mobile devices, the drop downs are replaced with simple tabs. Unlike the other websites, this one has a home page. To an extent, it makes the website a bit more inviting. It presents all of its features and tabs, and allows the user to explore what they want, when they want.
