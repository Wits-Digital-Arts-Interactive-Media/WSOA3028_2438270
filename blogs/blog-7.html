                <h2>Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information</h2>
                <p>
                    When thinking about information, and going through the readings, the theory of conservation of energy randomly came to mind. Information seems a lot like energy to me. In the sense that it can morph and change. Going from one form to another. The biggest difference being is the simple fact that energy cannot be created, but information can.

                    This is a very important, but often overlooked concept in understanding how our society works. Why we abide by the norms we’ve established. I use the term information a bit loosely here. By information, I mean knowledge. Not just information for computing. This is a point the reading by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Matthew A. Zook makes very clear. Information has a point of creation. This reading is made more interesting by the conversations we’ve had in the previous blog about digital inequality. Not to bring up too much philosophy, but this reading reminded me of Foucault and the theory of power. In the reading, they make references to how nations with oversaturated representation have the ability to shape the way we see the world. Nations of lesser representation are usually tossed aside and have their stories and experiences ignored, especially when analysed through a political lens. The more influence a person or nation possesses, the easier it is to impose their beliefs. This forming of knowledge though seized power is what made me think of Foucault.

                    An interesting thing brought up in the paper is this concept of the immutable mobile. As they defined it in the text, “information that can be transported without significant change to its inherent characteristics or meaning” (2015). I find this also very interesting because one issue you find when looking at information shared though geographies, you find that most times, the information is warped and transformed. I think its also important to note that it is not always intentionally and maliciously changed.

                    Quick sidenote: I was talking about the reading in chunks, and I just saw the Foucault reference in the text. That was kinda funny.

                    I understand that one of the characteristics of immutable mobiles is their ability to “take photos”. Take photos is a bit of a random phrase to use, but in this context, I was trying to find a world that would describe a capturing of a moment in an instant, in a form that is almost as authentic as experiencing in real time. The reading used the world “crystallise”. Like a photo, this geographical information can be moved and is no longer bound by geography.

                    Its interesting how most of these topics are connected. As mentioned in the text, understanding geographies of access and enablement can allow us to see how digital technologies are distributed, as the internet has become a huge facilitator of activity. Not just, it facilitates education, income generation etc. This reminds of digital inequality and how there’s a huge divide in who has access to technology and who doesn’t. 
                    It’s important to understand the complex reasons for why we have such disparities when it comes to information availability. Connectivity, data pricing, Wi-Fi availability. These all play a part, however, for something as fundamental as internet, measures have to be put in place to allow everyone a chance to access information regardless of geography.
