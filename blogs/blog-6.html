            <p>For this week’s blog post, we were given a variety of readings and were given the opportunity to pick what best spoke to us, and critically engage with the aspects that made sense to us.</p>

            <h2>Article 1: What is digital equality? An interview with Nanjira Sambuli</h2>
                <p>Find the article <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/digital-equality-interview-nanjira-sambuli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
                <p>
                    Before talking about the article, I think it would be a good idea to give some initial points. 
                    I hate that I have never thought critically about the inequality around technology and the internet. I always thought about it at its most surface level. Looking at it solely from the perspective of “some people are unfortunate to not have access to technology” and leaving it at that. I regret not looking deeper at this topic. At its most basic, I understand inequality in the digital age as an unfair distribution of access to digital technologies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During and post reading points:
                    After looking through the article, I can now adapt my thinking around the meaning of digital inequality. I now understand that the negative effects of digital inequality can be brought about by many different factors. Class, gender, geography. In the article, Sambuli states “only half of the world’s population is online; progress in getting more people connected has slowed down dramatically” (2019). This statement is baffling to say the least. Baffling and mildly enraging. I get upset because of the amount of electronic waste we see produced yearly. We as a society, as a species, produced way too much unjustifiable waste. With the amount of e-waste produced, an alien would assume every single person on this planet has owned a mobile device at some point in their lives. But that cannot be further from the truth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One other thing I found interesting about the reading is how Sambuli claims achieving a digitally equal society can help alleviate or rid the world of those aforementioned forms of inequality. The reason I say this, as I mentioned earlier, is because of my lack of critical engagement around these topics. Before going through this reading, I would have never thought of a fairer distribution of technology as a potential catalyst for societal change.

                <p><b>Access to the internet: Thoughts nobody asked for:</b></p>
                <p>
                    As much as I want to agree with Sambuli, a video I saw a while back comes to mind and forces me to reconsider. I definitely agree with the idea that digital inequality can exacerbate other forms of inequality, and that needs to be rectified. However, I also agree with the idea that we as a society have too much access to an ever-expanding, ever-growing repository of knowledge. I feel like we might be too connected. As much as I love knowledge, formally reserved to rich elitists, being accessible, I cannot push past the idea that we have way too much access to this information. In addition to the access, anyone can say anything at any time. Everyone is an expert online. The internet broke down the barrier completely. Now there is no filter to what we can know. What we can access. What we can say, hear, see. The human mind might not be capable of holding the amount of information on the web.
                    There’s information everyone should know, but there’s also a lot of information we don’t need to know. I’m not sure if anyone would agree with me on this point.

                    One the other hand, the access can allow is to see firsthand accounts of the experiences of others in an unprecedented way. People can educate themselves through this access. Empathise with the experiences of others. This access has broken barriers in a positive way as well. 
                    A good example of this are the journalists in Gaza. Risking life and limb to document the genocide in a way we’ve never experienced. Through their eyes and social media accounts. This is one of the examples where our access to the internet is an absolute positive.

            <h2>Article 2: Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the first thoughts I had while going through this text, was the positive aspect of our access to the internet that I mentioned in my “nobody asked” tangent session. Seeing as the internet is probably one of the best and fastest ways to share information around the globe, sector of this globe cut out from internet access presents a lot of disadvantages. The issue with television, particularly news channels, is the fact that it requires way more to operate than mobile devices. So, getting current affairs to people is a lot harder. This is where the internet provides a bridge. When large populations don’t have easy access to the internet, it causes a huge issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article makes a lot of great points about this disparity in few more situations. Seeing as the main method to slow down the spread of Covid-19 was to distance ourselves from each other, as Spyros Kasapis mentioned (2020), the need for online communication became more noticeable. Those that could not participate where unfairly left out. Not just left out when it comes to access to news, but communication, and potential streams of income. Education was also affected by global lockdowns. Those that didn’t have access to online classes were severely disadvantaged. This is something that needs to change. The world has created a monster with the internet. A lot of our lives depend on the internet, and a lack of access to it creates a huge disparity.
