            <p class="p-summary">Week 10 blog post: 
                <br>
                For this week’s blog post, we were required to choose a reading and develop a close reading.
            </p>

            <h2>Making A Feminist internet in Africa: Why the internet needs African Feminists and Feminism: Sheena Magenya</h2>
            <p>
                This reading provided light on a few very important concepts to note. Some within the context of feminism in the production of internet knowledge, while others refer to many aspects outside of feminism but are still heavily related to the grander understanding of ethical distributions of digital technology, inequality, de-colonialism etc. For one, Sheena points out an aspect of digital inequality that was overlooked during the pandemic. She mentions the phrase “well then, let’s just meet online” (2; 2020), when talking about the rift the Covid-19 pandemic created in relation to how we interact with each other, and the response people had to combat those challenges. This is interesting because she reminds us that this phrase throws a blanket of perceived access to the internet for everyone. “Presenting the internet as a solution to a social problem, as some kind of communication silver bullet that imagines an equality of access, use and representation on the internet which is false.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As I’ve mentioned in a previous blog post, understanding, and acknowledging the issues around digital inequality is extremely important, and I am glad Sheena makes that point in her reading. The pandemic really highlighted the gulf of haves and have nots between people, ranging from access to healthcare, all the way to access to the internet, which is often critically overlooked. This is her entry into the main argument of her paper. Why we need to make a feminist internet. To twist the idea that technology levels the playing field for everyone and is a full proof solution to fixing all our problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another point that is worth mentioning is putting African feminism at the forefront of this conversation, seeing as the initial waves of feminism excluded black and brown voices. This concept ties well with de-coloniality. Removing the west as the main developer of global knowledge, and centring the perspectives, lifestyles, and beliefs of indigenous peoples. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Including a feminist lens has a few benefits. One such example is present when looking at the formation of online communities. Providing a safer and more inclusive space. Originally, the internet was a space for homophobes, racists, and others who align themselves with fascist ideals to spread hatred and misinformation almost without repercussion. But through the advent of feminist internet, one can argue that these communities are reprimanded more intensely. These issues haven’t seized, but they have gotten better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, a feminist internet provides a new online experience. Remembering that the internet is not guaranteed for everyone is very important. The sentiment that echoes around the issues of this perceived universal access, which, when analysed further, reveals a falsehood. Including black and brown voices provides a greater frame of reference. It increases the pool of knowledge through the unique experiences and opinions. This allows for a more diverse repository of information.
