            <h1>Week 3 Blog Post</h1>
            <h2>Working through the slides for interaction design for the web, define and discuss your user alignment, and map out your sites content, experience, and interface element:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>User alignment:</b> 
                I want a slick and intuitive website that is both playful 
                (hoping this will show a bit of personality and make the website more interesting to look at and memorable), but also well designed. 
                Saying “well-designed” is a bit broad, so to narrow it, 
                I would replace “well-designed” with thoughtfully designed. I feel intentional design can be sensed by users. Similarly, thoughtless, 
                and sloppy design can be sensed by users. With that in mind, the goal is to produce a thoughtfully designed website where every feature, 
                button, font, etc. is intentionally chosen for a particular purpose.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <b>Site content:</b> 
                When thinking about the site content, I felt it wise to use questions asked in the slides as a framework:
                <p>
                    What types of content do you have? I will have text-based content in the form of the blog posts and essays, as well as my bio. 
                    In addition to the text-based content, I will also have some images for the portfolio section of my website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is most important? 
                    This is a bit of a tough question to answer because I feel all the content on the website would have to share the quality of importance. 
                    I would want to put the same amount of effort in everything. 
                    Seeing as this is an art portfolio, I feel users would want to engage with the portfolio pieces more. 
                    But then again, users could be interested in my written work just as much as the drawings. 
                    So, all the content should be created with intent and thoughtfulness. 
                </p>
                 <p>
                    What is most interesting?
                    This is also a subjective question as the blog posts and essays would excite the readers, 
                    while the drawings would excite those that visited the website for the artwork. 
                 </p>

            <h2>Reflect on your development progress for the week:</h2>
            <p>
                My development progress for the last 2 weeks has been slightly stunted. 
                I was a little behind on my dev blog posts, 
                so I had to do 2 in 1 week. 
                Despite the hiccup, I still feel I went through the work as attentively as I could. 
                At first, I did think we were offered too many readings for a web dev class. 
                But as I go through them, I feel they ask a lot of important questions and raise equally insightful points. 
                I get so caught up in making things because I “think it looks cool”, that I forget to recognise the importance of theory and intention. 
                Whether I like it or not, there is undeniable theory that goes into creating great and functional UI. 
                Getting the best out of the user experience. Understanding that certain fonts invoke certain emotions. 
                The theory of creation impacts the creation just as much as the process of production.
