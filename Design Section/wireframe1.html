            <p class="p-summary">Iteration 1 Wireframes for the desktop website:
                <br>
                Here are my 1st iteration wireframes for the various pages I'll have on the website. I have tried to list some advantages and disadvantages for each layout.
            </p>

            <h2>Desktop Home page idea 1</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 1.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                The main reason for this design choice, was its simplicity and effectiveness. I feel like this website design would accomplish its   intended purpose. Viewers would be able to navigate the website with relative ease. There is no unnecessary clutter to distract or  overwhelm the viewer. This seems to be a positive and negative. The viewer isn’t distracted by the backgrounds or a complicated UI layout. However, the simplistic design might be way too boring for some viewers.
            </p>

            <h2>Desktop Home page idea 2:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 2.png" alt="Home page wireframe 2" title="Home page wireframe 2" width="600">
            <p>
                The framework of this design and the last are effectively the same. The main aim was for a clean, minimalist appearance. 
                A non-cluttered UI interface. Similar to the first design, the main issue with this layout is it effectively boring to look at. 
                It feels very cookie-cutter. Which isn’t a bad thing, but it really soaks up excitement like a sponge. 
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 3:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 3.png" alt="Home page wireframe 3" title="Home page wireframe 3" width="600">
            <p>
                This is the design I liked out of the 3. This design is also very simplistic. However, the floating lettering telling the viewer what page they are on, as well as the uniform square buttons provide a much-needed touch of excitement. A cool little logo would 
                also push the excitement factor further. The only thing I’m left questioning is the home button. It seems kind of useless to have 
                a home button on the home page.
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 4:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 4.png" alt="Home page wireframe 4" title="Home page wireframe 4" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout removes the home button from the home page.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 5.png" alt="Blog page wireframe 1" title="Blog page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout is an extension of Home page idea 4. For this layout, it makes more sense to have the home button in the top center of the page. The floating lettering remain to give the page a cooler appearance. With this layout, the viewer can see all the blog posts as they load into the page. My only gripe with this is that it looks quite cluttered. 
            </p>

            <h2>Blog page idea 2:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 6.png" alt="Blog page wireframe 2" title="Blog page wireframe 2" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout removes the cluttered look of all the blog post buttons, replacing them with larger buttons in a row. 
                For this layout, the viewer would have to scroll across to access the other blog posts.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog post idea 3:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 7.png" alt="Blog page wireframe 3" title="Blog page wireframe 3" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout simply replaces the scrollbar with a button.
            </p>

            <h2>Portfolio page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 8.png" alt="Portfolio page wireframe 1" title="Portfolio page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                Like the blog post page, this variation employs a scrollbar.
            </p>

            <h2>Portfolio page idea 2:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 9.png" alt="Portfolio page wireframe 2" title="Portfolio page wireframe 2" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout uses buttons for navigation.
            </p>

            <h2>Essay page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 10.png" alt="Essay page wireframe 1" title="Essay page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout uses a scrollbar.
            </p>

            <h2>Essay page idea 2:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 11.png" alt="Essay page wireframe 2" title="Essay page wireframe 2" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout uses buttons. 
            </p>

            <h2>Info page:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 12.png" alt="Profile page wireframe 1" title="Profile page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p class="WireframeCaption">
                My info page will be fairly simple. The links to my Instagram and other pages will go in the green space.
            </p>
