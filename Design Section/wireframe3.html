            <p class="p-summary">Iteration 2 Wireframes for the desktop website:
                <br>
                Here are my 2nd iteration wireframes for the various pages I'll have on the website.
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 15.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout is inspired by Natalie Young’s artist portfolio. The arrows would indicate that users can interact with a drop-down menu. This layout is effective and communicates its purpose fairly well. Its isn’t too cluttered but it’s also not exciting. 
                It seems more professional than anything.
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 1 (extension):</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 16.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This is what the drop down menu’s will look like when the users hover over them. For the portfolio page and design section, users will be able to access specific ones directly. But for the blogs and essays, there are drop down menus within the drop-down menu. This helps to reduce the number of times the user has to click on a specific page, however the drop down menu within a drop down menu seems a bit daunting and uncomfortable to navigate.
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 1 (extension 2):</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 17.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This is how the Blog drop down would look like.
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 1 (extension 3):</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 18.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This is how the Essay drop down menu would look like.
            </p>

            <h2>Home page idea 2:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 19.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                The change in this wireframe is fairly unnoticeable. I decided to combine the portfolio and design section into one drop-down menu. This makes the nav bar look a little less cluttered. And this would refer back to my information structure where I group similar pieces of media together. The drop-down menu nestled inside of the drop menu is also removed. This also makes the UI look less cluttered, but in exchange for a bit of excitement.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 20.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                When the user clicks on the blog button, they will visit this page with all the blogs. The user can use the scrollbar to navigate further down. I can add a “back to top” button at the end of this page. To read a blog, the user can click on one of the blocks (buttons) to access the blog post. I like this page layout because it’s fairly simple, but effective and it won’t overwhelm the user. Leaving the nav bar at the top of the page provides quick access to other pages.
            </p>

            <h2>Essay page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 21.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout is similar to the blog page. This helps with consistency. Seeing as there aren’t too many essays compared to the blogs or portfolio, the essay buttons will be laid out next to each other.
            </p>

            <h2>Portfolio page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 22.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This page is identical to the blog page, seeing as this is one of the pages with a lot of content. It would make sense for this page to follow a similar layout. It’s not only because of the amount of content, this layout communicates very well. It’s very readable and does not overwhelm the senses. But once again, this website layout does spark a lot of emotion.It still does seem a bit cookie cutter. 
            </p>

            <h2>Profile page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 23.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This page follows the fairly simple template set by the previous wireframes. In the space above the links to my various pages, I’ll write a short paragraph about myself and what I like making. Or whatever comes to mind really. Then below that, I’ll have all my links and an email account.
            </p>

            <h2>Reading essay page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 24.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This layout would stay the same regardless of how the top nav bar looks like (“drawings and designs” or “portfolio” and “design section”). The huge green block indicates where the essay will be. The user will be able to download the paper. This is perhaps another spot where sending the user to a different page is the best play. The content is still grouped, as my info structure indicates, however, opening a new tab can provide the user a better scrolling experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Section (wireframes) page idea 1:</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Website Wireframe 25.png" alt="Home page wireframe 1" title="Home page wireframe 1" width="600">
            <p>
                This how I will present my wireframes. The user will be able to select the wireframe iteration they want to view. When on the page, they are able to scroll through the slideshow. The slides will also have captions and descriptions, so the user isn’t lost or confused. Annotating the images makes for better UX. This is a sentiment that is seen when looking at captions and descriptions for images in academic texts. So why not apply it here as well.
