            <h1>Wireframe ideas-Version 1</h1>
            <p>
                Here are my 1st iteration wireframes for the various pages I'll have on the website. I have tried to list some advantages and disadvantages for each layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 1:</b>
                The main reason for this design choice, was its simplicity and effectiveness. 
                I feel like this website design would accomplish its intended purpose. 
                Viewers would be able to navigate the website with relative ease. 
                There is no unnecessary clutter to distract or overwhelm the viewer. 
                This seems to be a positive and negative. The viewer isn’t distracted by the backgrounds or a complicated UI layout. 
                However, the simplistic design might be way too boring for some viewers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="/Images/1st Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 1st Home page Wireframe design." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 1">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 2:</b>
                The framework of this design and the last are effectively the same. 
                The main aim was for a clean, minimalist appearance. 
                A non-cluttered UI interface. 
                Similar to the first design, the main issue with this layout is it effectively boring to look at. 
                It feels very cookie-cutter. Which isn’t a bad thing, but it really soaks up excitement like a sponge. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="/Images/2nd Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 2nd Home page Wireframe design.." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 2">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 3:</b>
                This is the design I liked out of the 3. 
                This design is also very simplistic. 
                However, the floating lettering telling the viewer what page they are on, 
                as well as the uniform square buttons provide a much-needed touch of excitement. 
                A cool little logo would also push the excitement factor further. 
                The only thing I’m left questioning is the home button. It seems kind of useless to have a home button on the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="/Images/3rd Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 3rd Home page Wireframe design." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 3">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Home page idea 4:</b>
                This layout removes the home button from the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="/Images/4th Wireframe .png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 4th Home page Wireframe design." 
                title="Home page- Wireframe 4">
            </p>
            <P>
                <b>Blog page idea 1:</b>
                This layout is an extension of Home page idea 4. 
                For this layout, it makes more sense to have the home button in the top centre of the page. 
                The floating lettering remain to give the page a cooler appearance. 
                With this layout, the viewer can see all of the blog posts as they load into the page. 
                My only gripe with this is that it looks quite cluttered. 
    
            </P>

                <img src="/Images/5th Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 1st Blog post page design." 
                title="Blog page-Wireframe 1">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Blog page idea 2:</b>
                This layout removes the cluttered look of all the blog post buttons, 
                replacing them with larger buttons in a row. 
                For this layout, the viewer would have to scroll across to access the other blog posts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="/Images/6th Wireframe.png" 
                height="200" 
                alt="Picture of my 2nd Blog post page design." 
                title="Blog page-Wireframe 2">
            </p>
            <P>
                <b>Blog post idea 3:</b>
                This layout simply replaces the scrollbar with a button.
            </P>
            <p>
                <img src="/Images/7th Wireframe.png"

                title="Blog page-Wireframe 3">

            <P>
                <b>Portfolio page idea 1:</b>

                My info page will be fairly simple. The links to my Instagram and other pages will go in the green space.
