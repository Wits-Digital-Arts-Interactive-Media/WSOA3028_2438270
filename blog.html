                Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:

    <p>
        My experience with GitHub, this time around, was a bit tamer than it was last year. 
        Having some experience with GitHub in 2023 made the process of creating a repository and cloning a lot easier. 
        The only new thing was publishing to pages. I am still slightly unsure about the processes that go on behind the scenes when publishing to pages. 
        I just always assumed that web developers coded their websites and somehow it ends up on the internet. 
        It’s definitely my fault for not looking further into the actual processes that go into creating and sharing a website. 
        But at the moment, I feel optimistic about what will come of this module. 
        A little optimistic, and a little bit scared.

        One of the most interesting things about this reading, is how topical and timelessness it feels. 
        Despite it being written in 1994, most of the concepts we see today seem unchanged. You can tell the age of the test just by reading it. 
        There’s a “retro” feel to calling a computer a “desktop machine” (1994; 76). Despite this, the reading manages to feel present. 
        One other thing I found interesting, in the beginning of the reading, was the use of the word “object”. For example, the “object” in the URI paragraph, to me at least, represents the webpage itself. 
        The reason I say this is because of the reading’s phrasing. “… one can form an address for any object as the set of protocol parameters necessary to access the object”. 
        That line in the reading made me think the object in question is the website, specifically the “access the object”. I understood that line to mean a URI is used to access the website. 
        Having URIs as a concept in this reading tripped me up a bit because I got confused with URLs. Researching further, I learned that URIs and URLs are different things. A URL is a specific type of URI.
        The last thing I found interesting about this reading were the bullet points about the future of the web. 
        Its very interesting that most of the goals for the future of the web were realized, for example, “conventions on the Internet for charging and commercial use to allow direct access to for-profit services.” 
        I understand this to mean the ability to use the internet for commercial reasons. The monetization of the internet’s capabilities. Having the ability to buy and sell on the internet.

        One of the most interesting things I’ve learned about the internet is the impact it had. 
        The creation of the internet is one of the most important advancements in human history. 
        From entertainment to knowledge sharing, the internet was huge in terms of its cultural, societal, political shaping of the human consciousness and experience. 
        An impact that is almost unexplainable through words.

        Learn how to create an excellent website for my animation portfolio. 
        I believe having a very unique and well-designed website could enhance my art. 
        It could make it more attractive to people who want to hire me, or just people who want to enjoy my drawings, but I think attracting prospective employers would be the main goal for creating a great website. 
        And I feel the skills learned in this course will serve me for a while, seeing that the internet is growing and expanding, with a chance of it dying out nowhere nearby.

                Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:
            </b>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p> 
            As it is, my folder structure is simple. The image folder will hold the images I want to add to the page, while the JavaScript and CSS folders are empty, as of right now. 
            There’s a folder called “pages” mainly because I had planned on placing the index, the blog, the portfolio, and essay html files into that folder. 
            Less for functional reasons, but more for organizational purposes. This was until Hanli mentioned that the index must be the root or in the root (might be a bit unclear about that). 
            After she said this, I got a bit scared to put the index inside of a different folder in case it renders the webpage unusable.
            In terms of the URL scheme, I am yet to customize the URL scheme. 
            But as a reference to what I want to do, I am planning on having a clean and simple URL scheme. 
            The ideal scheme would either be one that allows the viewer to know exactly what pages they’ve interacted with (blogposts/blogpostweek2), or one that does not overwhelm the player (Home/BlogPostWeek2). 
            A URL scheme like that is easy to read and understand. In terms of performance, I’d strive for a URL scheme that works on the lowest bandwidth. 
            I think it would be beneficial to not overload the website with images and text that eat up data.

            •	Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: how does it speak to the internet today?

One thing I found interesting about the reading was the distinction between the internet and the Web. A quick google search and a BBC article immediately answered my question. The article differentiated the web and the internet in this way:
“The world wide web, or web for short, are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online.
But the internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on, as well as what emails and files travel across.”
https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/av/47523993

The reason this differentiation stood out to me was because of how interchangeable these words have become, and I think this was a good reminder that these concepts are very much different even though we might use them to define each other.  

One benefit of hypertext I got from the reading was the advantage of a “malleable” form of text. Unlike books, hypertext can be manipulated at will. The process in which these texts are edited and shared also differs to that of books. To edit a book would mean physically editing the text, and reprinting the book, which is an obviously tedious and arduous process. But with hyperlinks, a web dev can easily make changes to text and publish those changes almost instantly. These method of publication makes it easier for anyone to put their ideas out into the world without the limitations of printed text. Not to say that printed text has become or will become obsolete. 
“Nelson foresees a renovation of culture, a unification of discourse, a reader-and-writer’s paradise where all writing opens itself to/in the commerce of ideas. This is the world in which all “work” becomes “text,” not substance but reference, not containment but connection” (1991; 48). 
This quote exemplifies what I was talking about. The idea that hyperlinks could open the potential for anyone to produce and access information. This is definitely a positive and negative. the positive being the access to information being easily accessible to everyone and not reserved for the elitists. But on the flipside of that, you have the potential for the spread of misinformation. 
I believe the access to this information is a very big positive, but the production of the information should be reserved. This then brings up another daunting task. Who are those reserved to produce information? How do we qualify them? 
I didn’t think this reading would bring up so many philosophical points for me, but as I read it, my thinking went straight to those thoughts. I found it quite difficult to separate my analysis from those philosophical points.

            •	Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?

When I think about interaction, the quote by Lev Manovich. “As with digital I avoid using the word interactive in this book without qualifying it, for the same reason – I find the concept to be too broad to be truly useful… Once an object is represented in a computer, it automatically becomes interactive. Therefore, to call computer media ‘interactive’ is meaningless – it simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.” (Manovich, p55).

This is one of the more interesting quotes I’ve read regarding interaction, and it’s also why I struggle with defining “interaction”. As Manovich states, the most basic function of working on a computer could constitute interactivity. This way of reasoning makes it slightly difficult to really pin down the meaning of interaction. It is also important to acknowledge that this is interactivity from the framework of computers. Interacting with other forms of media requires a different approach. Gonzalo Frasca also made a point that I’d like to reference. When it comes to text-based media, the act of simply turning a page cannot be seen as interaction as the text is not being modified. 
Therefore, a happy medium would be something that combines the thoughts of Gonzalo Frasca and Espen Aarseth, who suggested the use of the word ergodic instead, describing ergodic literature as text that requires “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.”

            •	Reflection the door design video:
The video about design was very insightful and thought provoking. Don Norman’s take on design with functionality in mind is very useful to remember. If you design something with its functionality in mind, it sort of negates the need to overexplain the mechanics or functions of the webpage or the device. The explanation of how to use the item is embedded in its design.
