                    Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:

            My experience with GitHub, this time around, was a bit tamer than it was last year. 
            Having some experience with GitHub in 2023 made the process of creating a repository and cloning a lot easier. 
            The only new thing was publishing to pages. I am still slightly unsure about the processes that go on behind the scenes when publishing to pages. 
            I just always assumed that web developers coded their websites and somehow it ends up on the internet. 
            It’s definitely my fault for not looking further into the actual processes that go into creating and sharing a website. 
            But at the moment, I feel optimistic about what will come of this module. 
            A little optimistic, and a little bit scared.

        One of the most interesting things about this reading, is how topical and timelessness it feels. 
        Despite it being written in 1994, most of the concepts we see today seem unchanged. You can tell the age of the test just by reading it. 
        There’s a “retro” feel to calling a computer a “desktop machine” (1994; 76). Despite this, the reading manages to feel present. 
        One other thing I found interesting, in the beginning of the reading, was the use of the word “object”. For example, the “object” in the URI paragraph, to me at least, represents the webpage itself. 
        The reason I say this is because of the reading’s phrasing. “… one can form an address for any object as the set of protocol parameters necessary to access the object”. 
        That line in the reading made me think the object in question is the website, specifically the “access the object”. I understood that line to mean a URI is used to access the website. 
        Having URIs as a concept in this reading tripped me up a bit because I got confused with URLs. Researching further, I learned that URIs and URLs are different things. A URL is a specific type of URI.
        The last thing I found interesting about this reading were the bullet points about the future of the web. 
        Its very interesting that most of the goals for the future of the web were realized, for example, “conventions on the Internet for charging and commercial use to allow direct access to for-profit services.” 
        I understand this to mean the ability to use the internet for commercial reasons. The monetization of the internet’s capabilities. Having the ability to buy and sell on the internet.

        One of the most interesting things I’ve learned about the internet is the impact it had. 
        The creation of the internet is one of the most important advancements in human history. 
        From entertainment to knowledge sharing, the internet was huge in terms of its cultural, societal, political shaping of the human consciousness and experience. 
        An impact that is almost unexplainable through words.

        Learn how to create an excellent website for my animation portfolio. 
        I believe having a very unique and well-designed website could enhance my art. 
        It could make it more attractive to people who want to hire me, or just people who want to enjoy my drawings, but I think attracting prospective employers would be the main goal for creating a great website. 
        And I feel the skills learned in this course will serve me for a while, seeing that the internet is growing and expanding, with a chance of it dying out nowhere nearby.

                Discuss your folder structure and URL scheme. Outline your decision-making:
            </b>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p> 
            As it is, my folder structure is simple. The image folder will hold the images I want to add to the page, while the JavaScript and CSS folders are empty, as of right now. 
            There’s a folder called “pages” mainly because I had planned on placing the index, the blog, the portfolio, and essay html files into that folder. 
            Less for functional reasons, but more for organizational purposes. This was until Hanli mentioned that the index must be the root or in the root (might be a bit unclear about that). 
            After she said this, I got a bit scared to put the index inside of a different folder in case it renders the webpage unusable.
            In terms of the URL scheme, I am yet to customize the URL scheme. 
            But as a reference to what I want to do, I am planning on having a clean and simple URL scheme. 
            The ideal scheme would either be one that allows the viewer to know exactly what pages they’ve interacted with (blogposts/blogpostweek2), or one that does not overwhelm the player (Home/BlogPostWeek2). 
            A URL scheme like that is easy to read and understand. In terms of performance, I’d strive for a URL scheme that works on the lowest bandwidth. 
            I think it would be beneficial to not overload the website with images and text that eat up data.

                Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’: 
                how does it speak to the internet today?:
            </b>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        One thing I found interesting about the reading was the distinction between the internet and the Web. 
        A quick google search and a BBC article immediately answered my question. The article differentiated the web and the internet in this way:
        “The world wide web, or web for short, are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online.
        But the internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on, as well as what emails and files travel across.”
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/av/47523993">BBC Website article</a>
        </p>
        
        The reason this differentiation stood out to me was because of how interchangeable these words have become, and I think this was a good reminder that these concepts are very much different even though we might use them to define each other.  

        One benefit of hypertext I got from the reading was the advantage of a “malleable” form of text. Unlike books, hypertext can be manipulated at will. The process in which these texts are edited and shared also differs to that of books. 
        To edit a book would mean physically editing the text, and reprinting the book, which is an obviously tedious and arduous process. But with hyperlinks, a web dev can easily make changes to text and publish those changes almost instantly. 
        These method of publication makes it easier for anyone to put their ideas out into the world without the limitations of printed text. Not to say that printed text has become or will become obsolete. 
        “Nelson foresees a renovation of culture, a unification of discourse, a reader-and-writer’s paradise where all writing opens itself to/in the commerce of ideas. 
        This is the world in which all “work” becomes “text,” not substance but reference, not containment but connection” (1991; 48). 
        This quote exemplifies what I was talking about. The idea that hyperlinks could open the potential for anyone to produce and access information. 
        This is definitely a positive and negative. the positive being the access to information being easily accessible to everyone and not reserved for the elitists. 
        But on the flipside of that, you have the potential for the spread of misinformation. 
        I believe the access to this information is a very big positive, but the production of the information should be reserved. 
        This then brings up another daunting task. Who are those reserved to produce information? How do we qualify them? 
        I didn’t think this reading would bring up so many philosophical points for me, but as I read it, my thinking went straight to those thoughts. 
        I found it quite difficult to separate my analysis from those philosophical points.

                Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?:
            </b>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

        When I think about interaction, the quote by Lev Manovich. 
        “As with digital I avoid using the word interactive in this book without qualifying it, for the same reason – 
        I find the concept to be too broad to be truly useful… 
        Once an object is represented in a computer, it automatically becomes interactive. 
        Therefore, to call computer media ‘interactive’ is meaningless – it simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.” (Manovich, p55).

        This is one of the more interesting quotes I’ve read regarding interaction, and it’s also why I struggle with defining “interaction”. As Manovich states, the most basic function of working on a computer could constitute interactivity. This way of reasoning makes it slightly difficult to really pin down the meaning of interaction. It is also important to acknowledge that this is interactivity from the framework of computers. Interacting with other forms of media requires a different approach. Gonzalo Frasca also made a point that I’d like to reference. When it comes to text-based media, the act of simply turning a page cannot be seen as interaction as the text is not being modified. 
        Therefore, a happy medium would be something that combines the thoughts of Gonzalo Frasca and Espen Aarseth, who suggested the use of the word ergodic instead, describing ergodic literature as text that requires “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.”

    <p>
        The video about design was very insightful and thought provoking. 
        Don Norman’s take on design with functionality in mind is very useful to remember. 
        If you design something with its functionality in mind, it sort of negates the need to over-explain the mechanics or functions of the webpage or the device. 
        The explanation of how to use the item is embedded in its design.

                Working through the slides for interaction design for the web, 
                define and discuss your user alignment, and map out your sites content, 
                experience, and interface element:
            </b>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>User alignment:</b> 
        I want a slick and intuitive website that is both playful 
        (hoping this will show a bit of personality and make the website more interesting to look at and memorable), but also well designed. 
        Saying “well-designed” is a bit broad, so to narrow it, 
        I would replace “well-designed” with thoughtfully designed. I feel intentional design can be sensed by users. Similarly, thoughtless, 
        and sloppy design can be sensed by users. With that in mind, the goal is to produce a thoughtfully designed website where every feature, 
        button, font, etc. is intentionally chosen for a particular purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Site content:</b> 
        When thinking about the site content, I felt it wise to use questions asked in the slides as a framework:
        <p>
            What types of content do you have? I will have text-based content in the form of the blog posts and essays, as well as my bio. 
            In addition to the text-based content, I will also have some images for the portfolio section of my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is most important? 
            This is a bit of a tough question to answer because I feel all the content on the website would have to share the quality of importance. 
            I would want to put the same amount of effort in everything. 
            Seeing as this is an art portfolio, I feel users would want to engage with the portfolio pieces more. 
            But then again, users could be interested in my written work just as much as the drawings. 
            So, all the content should be created with intent and thoughtfulness. 
        </p>
         <p>
            What is most interesting?
            This is also a subjective question as the blog posts and essays would excite the readers, 
            while the drawings would excite those that visited the website for the artwork.

    <p>
        My development progress for the last 2 weeks has been slightly stunted. 
        I was a little behind on my dev blog posts, 
        so I had to do 2 in 1 week. 
        Despite the hiccup, I still feel I went through the work as attentively as I could. 
        At first, I did think we were offered too many readings for a web dev class. 
        But as I go through them, I feel they ask a lot of important questions and raise equally insightful points. 
        I get so caught up in making things because I “think it looks cool”, that I forget to recognise the importance of theory and intention. 
        Whether I like it or not, there is undeniable theory that goes into creating great and functional UI. 
        Getting the best out of the user experience. Understanding that certain fonts invoke certain emotions. 
        The theory of creation impacts the creation just as much as the process of production.

        <b>Goal Alignment:</b>

        <p>
            My Goal:
            I want a website that, at its base, is functional. 
            But beyond that, I want my website to be minimalist with a twist. 
            I don’t want my website to be too busy and distracting, but also not too simple that its extremely boring to engage with. 
            I don’t think I’ll be revolutionizing the web development industry with my design. 
            But regardless, I want a website that encourages its users to engage with all of its functions. 
            Presenting all of the websites features from the get-go is a good way to show the users all of their options and choices. 
            I also want a website that displays my art portfolio in a presentable way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Users:
            My user base would comprise of artsy folk that want to either watch my animations or look at my sketches. 
            I also image my user base would consist of artists that want to collaborate on work. 
            I want my users to enjoy my art on a streamlined website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Your Content:
            My content would comprise of blogs, essays and my art portfolio. 
            I imagine these are my main components. 
            Additionally, the website will have my bio, in case users want to follow my various pages, 
            as well as my design section in the event users want to know the process of how I made the website and why I made the decisions I made. 
            I hope users are most engaged with my blogs, essays and portfolio as I feel those took the most amount of effort to make.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        At this moment I feel like web design might be the hardest thing I have ever done. 
        I mentioned in an earlier post about how difficult it was to do all the theory. 
        I realise now how important it is to place the theory above all. 
        Every single decision I have made and am yet to has to be calculated and intentional. 
        I am very used to creating things with the sole idea being “I thought it was cool”. 
        I realise now that it is an unsustainable model. 
        I need more reasoning behind the work I do and only put in elements of my website when I deem them completely intentional.

        I think I’ve struggle with that the most. 
        Finding a reason for every decision. 
        A reason for the font I want to use. 
        A reason for why I want to put a picture in this specific place. 
        I might be exaggerating this, but I feel like I need to put myself in the headspace of being more intentional with my design choices. 

        I cannot really say I am proud of any specific moment right now. 
        I think I will be tested when java and CSS are introduced, but for now, 
        I am proud of being able to actually publish a somewhat half working website.
